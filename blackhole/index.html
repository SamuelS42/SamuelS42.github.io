    <h1>How to play</h1>
    <span>
      Two players take turns placing pieces numbered 1 to 10 into a pyramid shaped board in order.</br>
      When all the pieces have been placed there will be one space left,</br>
      this space becomes the "black hole" and sucks all the adjacent pieces in.</br>
      The player who has the least points sucked in wins.

      this intro page looks awful and will be fixed soon.
